Day 1 : (Date - 21 Jan 2026)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Java ? (James Goshlins)(deveploped by sun microsystem in 1995)
-> Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language used to develop desktop applications, 
web applications, and enterprise-level systems.

-> Java is platform independent, but the JVM is platform dependent

What is JDK ?
-> Java Development Kit (tools + compiler)
provides the tools, libraries, and runtime environment necessary to write, compile, debug, and 
run Java applications.

What is JRE ?
-> Java Runtime Environment (libraries + JVM)
The JRE provides the core libraries and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) needed to execute Java programs

What is JVM ?
-> Java Virtual Machine (runs bytecode)
It is An abstract computing machine that enables Java programs to run on any device or operating system

It is the core component of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) responsible for executing Java bytecode

JVM provides memory management, security, and garbage collection.


“JDK contains JRE, and JRE contains JVM.”

Why main is Static ?
->JVM can call it without creating an object

Difference between JDK and JRE?
-> JDK is used for development, while JRE is used for running Java applications.


Data Types

Primitive Datatype-
1 int 
2 float
3 double
5 char
6 long  
7 boolean


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is JVM
JVM Stands for Java Virtual Machine its used to execute the bytecode or run the java applications
or.class file on any os

Difference between JDK and JRE?
JDK is used for development, while JRE is used for running Java applications.
JDK
it Stand for Java Development Kit
it Development tool kit for java developers
it contains JRE and JVM
it provides to write compile and debug the code
JRE
it Stands for Java Runtime Environment
it Provides core libraries of java and JMV

Why Java is platform independent?
 Because java code compile in any os but the catch is that Java is platform independent
 but the jvm is platform dependent we need Different jvm according to Different os


What happens after writing .java file?
We compile the .java file using the cmd javac File_name.java
the next step is after writing code is compiling

Operators in Java

1 Arithmatic Operators
    +   -   *   /   %

2 Relational / Conditional Operators
    >  <  >=  <=  ==  !=

3 Logical Operators
    &&   ||   !


Control Statements

1 if–else
    If 'if' block Expression / Condition is True then it execute the 'if' block
    IF 'if' block Expression / Condition is false then it execute the 'else' block

2 else-if ladder
    More than one 'if' is need in the program we use use 'else if' ladder 
    If 'if' block Expression / Condition is false then it execute the 'else if' block (if it exist in the program)

3 switch
    Switch case is used when we have multiple conditions to check for the same variable. 



Loops

while Loop
    The while loop that executes a block of code repeatedly as long as the given condition is true.

do while loop
    The do-while loop that executes a block of code at least once, and then continues 
    execution as long as the condition is true.

for Loop
    The for loop is an entry-controlled loop used when the number of iterations is known in advance.

Day 3 : (Date - 23 Jan 2026)

Method + Problem Solving Skill


1 What is Method in Java ?
-> A method is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be reused whenever needed.


2 Why we use methods?
->
    Code reusability
    Cleaner programs
    Easier debugging
    Modular programming

3.Why methods are static here?
-> Because main is static, so it can only call static methods directly.


xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Day 4 : (Date - 24 Jan 2026)

1.What is a Class?
->  A class is a blueprint/template used to create objects.


*MPORTANT CLASS-RELATED KEYWORDS

| Keyword      | Use                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |
| `class`      | Define a class           |
| `new`        | Create object            |
| `this`       | Current object reference |
| `static`     | Belongs to class         |
| `final`      | Cannot change / inherit  |
| `abstract`   | Incomplete class         |
| `extends`    | Inheritance              |
| `implements` | Interface implementation |

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.What is an Object?
->  An object is a real-world entity created from a class.


* OBJECT HAS 3 MAIN THINGS

| Term         | Meaning                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| **State**    | Data (variables)           |
| **Behavior** | Methods (functions)        |
| **Identity** | Unique reference in memory |



* MEMORY CONCEPT (IMPORTANT)

| Memory Area | Stores                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| **Heap**    | Actual object             |
| **Stack**   | Object reference variable |



* TYPES OF OBJECTS IN JAVA
| Type                 | Meaning                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Real Object**      | Created using `new` keyword  |
| **Anonymous Object** | Object without reference     |
| **Reference Object** | Holds address of real object |


* IMPORTANT OBJECT KEYWORDS

| Keyword   | Use                      |
| --------- | ------------------------ |
| `new`     | Creates object           |
| `this`    | Refers to current object |
| `null`    | No object reference      |
| `clone()` | Copy object              |


WHAT HAPPENS IF OBJECT = NULL?

Student s1 = null;
s1.study();  // Exception : NullPointerException


*Key Points
    Objects are stored in heap memory
    Reference variables are stored in stack
    Multiple objects can be created from one class
    Each object has its own copy of instance variables
    Garbage Collector removes unused objects

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.What is a Constructor in Java?

->  A constructor is a special block of code that runs automatically when an object is created.
Its main job is to initialize the object’s data.

    eg-
    Student s1 = new Student(); // Constructor runs here

    As soon as new Student() happens → constructor executes


* RULE OF CONSTRUCTOR

| Rule                 | Explanation                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
|   Same name as class | `Student()` inside class Student |
|   No return type     | Not even `void`                  |
|   Runs automatically | When object is created           |
|   Can be overloaded  | Multiple constructors allowed    |


Types of Constructor-
-> default Constructor

-> parameterized Constructor

-> copy constructor -A copy constructor in Java is a constructor that initializes
 a new object using another object of the same class.

Day 5 : (Date - 25 Jan 2026)

this Keyword + Constructor Overloading + Encapsulation

1. this keyword 
-> this refers to current object of a class

2. Why do we need this?
-> When local variables (parameters) and instance variables have the same name.
Without this, Java gets confused between instance variable and parameter.


* Uses of this

| Use                             | Example             |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Refer instance variables        | `this.name = name;` |
| Call current class method       | `this.display();`   |
| Call current class constructor  | `this(10);`         |
| Pass current object as argument | `someMethod(this);` |


* Example — Calling Method Using this
->
class Demo {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }

    void display() {
        this.show();  // calling method
    }
}

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Constructor Overloading
->
Having encapsulation means using multiple constructors with different parameter lists
Java decides which constructor to run based on arguments.



eg->
Constructor Chaining using this()

class Student {
    String name;
    int age;

    Student() {
        this("Unknown", 0);  // calls 2nd constructor
    }

    Student(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ENCAPSULATION 

-> Encapsulation = Wrapping data + methods together and hiding data using private variables
                                            OR
-> Wrapping data (variables) and methods together in a class and restricting direct access using private.


Why use Encapsulation?
-> Security + Control over data

Without Encapsulation
eg -
class Student {
    String name;
    int age;
}

Student s = new Student();
s.age = -100;  // Invalid data but allowed 


| Type               | How                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Fully Encapsulated | All variables private |
| Read-Only          | Only getters          |
| Write-Only         | Only setters          |

Day 6 : (Date - 28 Jan 2026)

Inheritance in Java

What is Inheritance ?
-> Inheritance allows one class to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class.

-> Child class uses Parent class features

It helps in:
    Code reuse
    Real-world modeling
    Method extension

eg-

class Parent {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Parent method");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Child method");
    }
}


Type of Inheritance-

| Type                      | Supported in Java? |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Single                    | ✅                  |
| Multilevel                | ✅                  |
| Hierarchical              | ✅                  |
| Multiple (via classes)    | ❌                  |
| Multiple (via interfaces) | ✅                  |


1.Single Inheritace 
-> One Parent(Base class) -> One Child(Derived Class)

eg-
class A{
}
class B extends A{
}


2.Multilevel Inheritance
-> Grandparent class→ Parent class → Child class

eg-
class A{
}
class B extends A{
}
class C extends B{
}


3.Hierarchical Inheritace
-> One Parent -> Many Children

eg-
Class A{
}
Class B extends A{
}
class C extends A{
}

4 Multiple Inheritance
Many Parant -> One Child
"Not Supported by Java Multiple Inheritace using class"

eg-
class A{
}
class B extends A{
}
class C extends A{
}
//Below class is Hypothetical (Not Allowed in java)
class D extends B,C{

}

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Super Keyword

Used to refer to parent class


| Use                     | Example        |
| ----------------------- | -------------- |
| Call parent variable    | `super.x`      |
| Call parent method      | `super.show()` |
| Call parent constructor | `super()`      |


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Method Overriding (IMPORTANT)

Child class provides its own version of parent method.


eg- 
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

Day 7 : (Date - 28 Jan 2026)        //Same Day...!

Polymorphism

What is Polymorphism ?
->
    Poly = Many
    Morph = forms

-> Polymorphism means ONE thing behaving in MANY different ways



Real-life example

You =
    Student in college
    Son at home
    Developer while coding

Same person → different roles. That’s polymorphism.




Types of Polymorphism


| Type                          | Also Called        | Happens When                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Compile-time Polymorphism** | Method Overloading | Same method name, different parameters |
| **Runtime Polymorphism**      | Method Overriding  | Parent reference, child object         |





Compile Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
->
eg-

class Calculator{

    int add(int a, int b){
        return a + b;
    }

    double add(double a, double b){
        return a + b;
    }

    int add(int a, int b, int c){
        return a + b + c;
    }
}

class Test{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Calculator c = new Calculator();

        System.out.println(c.add(2,3));        // int version
        System.out.println(c.add(2.5,3.5));    // double version
        System.out.println(c.add(1,2,3));      // 3-parameter version
    }
}





Puntime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)
->
eg-

class Animal{
    void sound(){
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal{
    @Override
    void sound(){
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal{
    @Override
    void sound(){
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}





Overview

| Feature              | Overloading  | Overriding |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Polymorphism Type    | Compile-time | Runtime    |
| Method Name          | Same         | Same       |
| Parameters           | Different    | Same       |
| Inheritance Required | ❌          | ✅         |
| Decided When         | Compile Time | Runtime    |
