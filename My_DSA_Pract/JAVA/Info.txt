--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Java ? (James Goshlins)(deveploped by sun microsystem in 1995)
-> Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language used to develop desktop applications, 
web applications, and enterprise-level systems.

-> Java is platform independent, but the JVM is platform dependent

What is JDK ?
-> Java Development Kit (tools + compiler)
provides the tools, libraries, and runtime environment necessary to write, compile, debug, and 
run Java applications.

What is JRE ?
-> Java Runtime Environment (libraries + JVM)
The JRE provides the core libraries and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) needed to execute Java programs

What is JVM ?
-> Java Virtual Machine (runs bytecode)
It is An abstract computing machine that enables Java programs to run on any device or operating system

It is the core component of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) responsible for executing Java bytecode

JVM provides memory management, security, and garbage collection.


“JDK contains JRE, and JRE contains JVM.”

Why main is Static ?
->JVM can call it without creating an object

Difference between JDK and JRE?
-> JDK is used for development, while JRE is used for running Java applications.


Data Types

Primitive Datatype-
1 int 
2 float
3 double
5 char
6 long  
7 boolean


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is JVM
JVM Stands for Java Virtual Machine its used to execute the bytecode or run the java applications
or.class file on any os

Difference between JDK and JRE?
JDK is used for development, while JRE is used for running Java applications.
JDK
it Stand for Java Development Kit
it Development tool kit for java developers
it contains JRE and JVM
it provides to write compile and debug the code
JRE
it Stands for Java Runtime Environment
it Provides core libraries of java and JMV

Why Java is platform independent?
 Because java code compile in any os but the catch is that Java is platform independent
 but the jvm is platform dependent we need Different jvm according to Different os


What happens after writing .java file?
We compile the .java file using the cmd javac File_name.java
the next step is after writing code is compiling

Operators in Java

1 Arithmatic Operators
    +   -   *   /   %

2 Relational / Conditional Operators
    >  <  >=  <=  ==  !=

3 Logical Operators
    &&   ||   !


Control Statements

1 if–else
    If 'if' block Expression / Condition is True then it execute the 'if' block
    IF 'if' block Expression / Condition is false then it execute the 'else' block

2 else-if ladder
    More than one 'if' is need in the program we use use 'else if' ladder 
    If 'if' block Expression / Condition is false then it execute the 'else if' block (if it exist in the program)

3 switch
    Switch case is used when we have multiple conditions to check for the same variable. 



Loops

while Loop
    The while loop that executes a block of code repeatedly as long as the given condition is true.

do while loop
    The do-while loop that executes a block of code at least once, and then continues 
    execution as long as the condition is true.

for Loop
    The for loop is an entry-controlled loop used when the number of iterations is known in advance.
